        'An intrusion detection system that uses surveillance cameras to monitor farms, detect animals or humans, and alert farmers in case of an encroachment.',
      tasks:
        'Developed an animal encroachment detection system using surveillance cameras to monitor farms. The system detects motion, then applies object detection using CNN to classify the object as either an animal or a human. Utilized data augmentation to enhance model performance, and implemented night vision enhancement to ensure functionality in low-light conditions. Alerts are sent to the farmer in case of intrusion.',
